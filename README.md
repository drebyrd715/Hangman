# Hangman Game 
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in JavaScript. The game randomly selects a word, and the player has to guess the letters in the word within a certain number of attempts.

 ## Installation 
 1. Clone the repository or download the source code. 
 2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor. 

 ## Usage 
 1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. 
 2. The game will start automatically. 
 3. Guess letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard. 
 4. The game will provide feedback on your guesses and update the displayed word accordingly. 
 5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the word or run out of attempts. 

 ## Customization 
 You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the JavaScript code. - To add more words and hints, open the `wordlist.js` file and add words and hints to the `wordlist` array. - To adjust the number of attempts allowed, modify the `maxGuesses` variable in the `script.js` file. - To change the visual design, modify the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file.
