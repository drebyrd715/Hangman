I created a hangman game using HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
 The user has a random word selected from an array of words I created. The game begins once you select your first letter with your mouse. 

Each letter you choose counts as a guess. If the letter you selected is in the current word, it replaces an underscore with that letter and adds it into the correct guess array.

If the letter you selected is wrong you lose one of your guess amounts and it is displayed in the incorrect guesses section. 

Each time you play there is a random word logged in the console.

With each guess amount you have left there is a new picture that will appear on the screen. 

Once you are all out of guesses an image will appear telling you the correct word. The same will happen if you win. 

A few seconds after this the window will reload and you will be able to play again with a new random word.
